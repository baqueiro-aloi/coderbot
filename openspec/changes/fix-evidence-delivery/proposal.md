## Why

PR #114 recorded passing demos but its filtered-run validator rejected them; codebot then cached an empty delivery as complete. Later requests were diverted to product replanning, and messages claiming to share videos contained zero attachments. Evidence delivery must be independently verifiable and recoverable.

## What Changes

- Validate filtered demo inventories separately from full-suite verification, without accepting failed or omitted cases.
- Unify recording and supplied-artifact handling with snapshot/run provenance, clip deduplication, unique MP4 outputs and media validation.
- Retry empty, failed or stale delivery checkpoints without repeating successful recording or duplicating uploads.
- Route evidence delivery requests through controller-owned delivery at safe points, independently of product replanning and merge authorization.
- Deliver real attachments or verified links; distinguish upload, reviewer access, PR synchronization and notification outcomes.
- Provide an explicit, nonautomatic recovery procedure for PR #114 after deployment.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
- `verified-evidence-delivery`: Provenance-bound, retryable demo delivery through recording, conversion, Drive, PR synchronization and conversation notification.

### Modified Capabilities

None. Existing review gates and milestone communication remain applicable.

## Impact

Codebot: `src/evidence.py`, `src/artifact_manifest.py`, `src/delivery_checkpoint.py`, `src/drive_client.py`, `src/feedback.py`, `src/main.py`, configuration, tests and operational documentation. No deployment, external upload, merge or live-state mutation is performed by implementation tests.

The PICA `e2e/validate-results.cjs` fix belongs to a separate repository/change; this repo-local change includes its regression contract and coordinated follow-up, not unauthorized edits to that checkout. A local checkout was discovered at `/Users/baqueiro/repos/aloi/features/ejecuciones-mensuales/processing-interface-claude-analytics`; its branch and working changes must be checked before separately authorized implementation.
