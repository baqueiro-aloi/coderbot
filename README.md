# coderbot

Autonomous coding agent that works the improvements backlog — a Google Doc
(`CODEBOT_DOC_ID`), a GitHub Projects v2 board (`CODEBOT_TASK_SOURCE=github`),
or a Jira Cloud project (`CODEBOT_TASK_SOURCE=jira`) —
of whatever target repo you point it at (`CODEBOT_REPO_PATH`), plans with the
managed OpenSpec workflow via a selectable headless coding agent (Claude Code or
OpenCode), and talks to the team by email (default) or Slack (`CODEBOT_COMM_CHANNEL=slack`).
Several instances can share a backlog; Slack instances each use their own app.

## Repository layout

- `src/` — the bot: `main.py` (state machine), `config.py`, `prompts.py`, the
  agent runners and the Gmail/Docs clients. Flat modules, imported by name.
- `tests/` — unit tests (`python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -t .`).
- `scripts/` — `setup.sh` (guided host setup), `setup_oauth.py` (Google consent
  flow), `entrypoint.sh` and `healthcheck.sh` (container runtime).
- `agent-plugin/` — the Claude/OpenCode plugin injected into agent sessions.
- `openspec/` — this repo's own OpenSpec specs and changes.
- `data/` — durable runtime state (git-ignored, bind-mounted into the container).

## Target repo prerequisites

Coderbot lives in its own repo and is pointed at a target checkout via
`CODEBOT_REPO_PATH`. Two pieces of target-repo infrastructure make codebot's
lifecycle stricter, but neither is a hard requirement — codebot auto-detects
each at the start of every task and adapts, self-healing the gap if it's
missing:

- An **`e2e/` test harness**, run via `e2e/run.sh` as the pre-PR gate. Either
  tool is supported, detected by what's under `e2e/`:
  - **Playwright** (web UI) — `e2e/playwright.config.ts`; specs live under
    `e2e/tests/`; evidence is a stitched video from `test-results/`.
  - **Newman/Postman** (API-only repos with no frontend) — collections under
    `e2e/collections/*.postman_collection.json`; evidence is the generated
    run report from `test-results/`.
  - **Missing**: the e2e gate is skipped for the current task, and codebot
    adds a backlog item requesting the harness (Playwright if the repo has a
    frontend, Newman otherwise) so a later task can build it.
- A **`Code Review` GitHub Actions workflow** — matched by its declared
  top-level workflow `name:` being exactly `Code Review` — drives the
  automated review loop. Codebot's self-healing item asks for this to be
  built on [alibaba/open-code-review](https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review)
  (OpenCodeReview), an Anthropic-backed automated PR reviewer, with the
  workflow named `Code Review` (not OpenCodeReview's own suggested workflow
  name) and posting under the default `github-actions[bot]` identity — both
  required for codebot's detection and review-thread polling to see it.
  - **Missing**: the post-PR review wait is skipped and the PR is emailed to
    the user immediately, and codebot adds a backlog item requesting the
    workflow (set `CODEBOT_SELF_HEAL_CODE_REVIEW=off` to not add it).

OpenSpec owns requirements, design, and tasks; Superpowers owns engineering
discipline; coderbot owns state, archive timing, push, PR, and merge. The image
supplies managed, pinned OpenSpec 1.9.0 and Superpowers v6.3.0 integrations for
both Claude Code and OpenCode: the `openspec-*` skills (`openspec-explore`,
`openspec-propose`, `openspec-apply-change`, …) are generated at image build time by
the pinned `openspec init` into `/opt/coderbot/openspec-skills` and loaded as a Claude
plugin dir / an OpenCode `skills.paths` entry, so target repos need neither an
`openspec init` of their own nor a Superpowers installation.

## Backlog sources

`CODEBOT_TASK_SOURCE` selects where tasks come from: `gdoc` (default), `github`,
or `jira`. `CODEBOT_COMM_CHANNEL` independently selects `email` (default) or
`slack`: GDoc+Slack and Jira+email both work.
`main.py` only talks to the `task_source` façade; each backend implements the same
operations (list pending, claim, hold, unclaim, mark done, seed an item, link the
PR). Items keep their text as the identity the agent sees, plus a backend id.

### Google Doc (`CODEBOT_TASK_SOURCE=gdoc`)

The backlog is a Google Doc (`CODEBOT_DOC_ID`). Each **top-level bullet** is one task.
Indented sub-bullets under it are the user's clarifications and sub-requirements of
that task (any nesting level) and are shown to the agent with it — never picked on
their own. Inline images pasted under a bullet (as their own paragraph or inside a
sub-bullet) are downloaded to `data/doc_images/` and handed to the exploration
session as screenshots. Struck-through bullets are done; codebot strikes a task
through (sub-bullets included) when its PR merges or on `DONE`.

To force an order, write `Codebot[1]`, `Codebot[2]`, ... anywhere in a task's text:
tagged tasks are picked before untagged ones, lowest number first (untagged tasks wait
until no tagged task is left). The tag stays part of the task text.

Set `CODEBOT_DOC_SECTION` to a heading text (e.g. `New:`) to make only the bullets
under that heading pickable — items under other headings (say, "Under review:") are
left alone. Unset, every top-level bullet in the doc is a candidate. Picking a task
appends `[implementing: <instance>@<fingerprint>]` to its bullet so other instances sharing the doc
skip it; the marker is removed when the task completes or is aborted. A task parked
with the HOLD command carries `[on hold: <instance>@<fingerprint>]` instead and is skipped by everyone
until CONTINUE (see "Mailbox commands").

When codebot is idle it picks, in this order: a held task whose CONTINUE was requested;
a task it already claimed but lost track of (e.g. `data/` was rebuilt); the
`Codebot[n]` tagged task(s) with the lowest number; otherwise the coding agent chooses
among all pending items (prerequisites and enablers first).

### GitHub Projects v2 (`CODEBOT_TASK_SOURCE=github`)

The backlog is a Projects v2 board (`CODEBOT_GH_PROJECT_URL`, e.g.
`https://github.com/orgs/getriverly/projects/3`, or `CODEBOT_GH_PROJECT_OWNER` +
`CODEBOT_GH_PROJECT_NUMBER`). A task is a board card backed by an **issue of the
target repo** (the checkout's `origin`, or `CODEBOT_GH_ISSUE_REPO`): the issue title
is the task text, its body the clarifications, and images in the body are downloaded
to `data/gh_images/`. Draft cards, pull-request cards, cards from other repos and
closed issues are ignored (the log says how many).

Cards move through the board's **Status** field (names configurable, matched
case-insensitively):

| Event | Status | Labels on the issue |
|---|---|---|
| pickable | one of `CODEBOT_GH_PROJECT_PICK_STATUSES` (default `Ready`) | none |
| picked | `In progress` | `codebot:<instance>@<fingerprint>` |
| PR opened | `In review` (PR linked in a comment; PR body says `Closes #n`) | unchanged |
| HOLD | unchanged | `codebot-hold:<instance>@<fingerprint>` |
| ABORT | first pick status | removed |
| merged / DONE | `Done` | removed |

`Codebot[n]` in an issue title orders tasks as in the Doc; without a tag, a
single-select **Priority** field on the board orders them by option position.
Self-healing items (missing e2e harness / Code Review workflow) are created as real
issues and placed in the pick column. The labels are created on first start;
`GH_TOKEN` needs the `project` scope in addition to `repo` (a classic PAT's
`read:project` cannot move cards; an SSO-protected org needs the token authorized).

### Jira Cloud (`CODEBOT_TASK_SOURCE=jira`)

Configure `CODEBOT_JIRA_URL=https://<site>.atlassian.net`, `CODEBOT_JIRA_PROJECT_KEY`,
`CODEBOT_JIRA_EMAIL` and an account `CODEBOT_JIRA_API_TOKEN` (create one at
[Atlassian account security](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)). Set the **issue workflow**
status names (`CODEBOT_JIRA_PICK_STATUS`, `CODEBOT_JIRA_ACTIVE_STATUS`,
`CODEBOT_JIRA_REVIEW_STATUS`, `CODEBOT_JIRA_DONE_STATUS`) to statuses that exist in
your project; these are not board columns. Only issues in the pick status are offered.
Set `CODEBOT_JIRA_PICK_LABEL` to a Jira label such as `codebot-ready` and add
that label to each issue Coderbot may take. **Both** the eligible status and the
label are required for a new task. A task this instance already claimed remains
recoverable if someone removes the opt-in label later; the ownership label is
separate. The opt-in label is retained on hold, abort and completion. Self-healing
issues created by Coderbot receive it automatically.
After you enter the Jira site, project key, account email and API token,
`scripts/setup.sh` queries that project's workflow statuses and lets you map
all four using dropdowns (numbered choices in `--text` mode). If access fails,
the wizard asks you to correct the connection instead of guessing status names.
Individual issue workflows can still restrict transitions; Coderbot checks
each transition when it acts on an issue.
The project key is the short prefix in issue IDs: `ENG` in `ENG-42`, visible in
the issue URL (`.../browse/ENG-42`) or Jira's Project settings. It is not the
full project name or a UUID, and it need not be exactly three or four letters.
The issue summary is the task; rich descriptions and attached images are delivered
to the coding agent. `Codebot[n]` in the summary takes priority.

Claims use `codebot-claim-<instance>-<fingerprint>` labels; HOLD uses
`codebot-hold-<instance>-<fingerprint>`. After a PR opens, the issue moves to the
configured review status, remains open, and records the PR URL in a comment. The
PR body contains `Closes <JIRA-KEY>` and a clickable Jira link for context; Coderbot
explicitly transitions Jira to done after merging or on DONE (GitHub does not
automatically close Jira issues). ABORT restores the pick status. Self-healing
items are created as issues of `CODEBOT_JIRA_ISSUE_TYPE` (default `Task`).

### Activity trail

Whatever the source, codebot leaves a log on the item itself (`CODEBOT_ACTIVITY_TRAIL`,
default on): a note at every milestone — picked and branch, proposal sent, approval,
each question and the user's answer, implemented, verified, reviewed, e2e result,
archived, PR opened, review rounds, PR ready, conflicts resolved, merged/done, hold,
resume, abort, stuck — with the full message body, so the ticket reads as the task's
history. On GitHub each note is a comment on the issue. On the Google Doc the first
note creates a doc-level comment quoting the item and later notes are replies in that
thread (the Drive API cannot anchor comments to a bullet), which needs the full
`drive` OAuth scope: installations set up before this option must re-run
`python3 scripts/setup_oauth.py` once. A tracker failure is logged and never
affects the task. On Jira, notes become issue comments.

## Conversation channels

Email is the default (`CODEBOT_COMM_CHANNEL=email`): `CODEBOT_USER_EMAIL` receives
task threads and its listed senders can reply or issue commands. In Slack mode set
`CODEBOT_COMM_CHANNEL=slack`, `CODEBOT_SLACK_CHANNEL_ID` (public `C...` channel),
`CODEBOT_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` (`xoxb-...`) and `CODEBOT_SLACK_APP_TOKEN` (`xapp-...`).
Create and install **one Slack app per Coderbot instance**. Enable Socket Mode and
an app-level token with `connections:write`; grant the bot `chat:write`,
`channels:history`, `channels:read`, `files:write`, and subscribe to
`message.channels` events.
Invite each app to the public channel. Coderbot posts one root message when it
claims a task. Approvals, questions, PR review, STATUS/ABORT/DONE/HOLD/CONTINUE and
check-ins stay in that task's replies; any human member of the channel can act.
Top-level messages are ignored except `status?`/`STATUS`, which receives a short
answer in a reply thread under that message (a bare request is visible to every
codebot app in the channel). Replies to other bots' task threads are ignored. Socket
Mode records incoming replies immediately; if an event is missed, the waiting
thread is reconciled from Slack history at most once a minute. If replies only
arrive through reconciliation, check that Event Subscriptions is enabled and
`message.channels` is subscribed for this app. An in-flight coding-agent turn
finishes before Coderbot acts on task-changing replies; brief `STATUS` replies are
served independently without interrupting that turn. A dirty checkout before a
task starts is announced once in the channel and automatically rechecked; replies to that
operational notice are ignored. Small screenshots and reports are shared in
the task thread; large evidence videos are linked from Google Drive.
For each task, the language of its title and details in Jira, GitHub Projects or
Google Docs is recorded in task state and used for agent output, OpenSpec
artifacts and outgoing task messages. A later reply in another language does
not change that task language; code, identifiers and control commands retain
their original spelling.

## Lifecycle

```
IDLE → pick item (see "Backlog sources") → claim it → branch <instance>-<slug>
      → EXPLORING → PROPOSING → send proposal → WAIT_APPROVAL
     → IMPLEMENTING → VERIFYING → INTERNAL_REVIEW → E2E (when present)
     → ARCHIVING → OPEN_PR → WAIT_REVIEW ⇄ ADDRESS_REVIEW → PUSHING (if review fixes exist)
     → send PR + evidence → WAIT_MERGE ⇄ ADDRESS_PR_THREADS → PUSHING
     → merge → mark item done (Doc / GitHub board / Jira workflow) → IDLE
WAIT_REVIEW / WAIT_MERGE ⇄ RESOLVE_CONFLICTS → PUSHING   (when the base branch moves)
```

If an E2E repair changes tracked files, coderbot repeats verification and internal
review before retrying E2E. OpenSpec archive/spec sync occurs on the feature branch
before PR creation, so it lands atomically with the implementation.
Coderbot independently validates the active change and confirms OpenSpec apply progress
is complete after the agent's verification report. Post-PR agent fixes enter a persisted
`PUSHING` phase, so a failed or interrupted push retries without rerunning agent work.
Archive retries include untracked OpenSpec files in cleanliness checks and stage only
the validated spec, active-change, and archive paths. If archive recovery needs human
guidance, the existing agent session may repair and commit only OpenSpec planning/spec
files before coderbot retries archival.

### Review-friendly task messages

Each task thread gets a brief, illustrated announcement at most once for each reached
milestone: **exploration → proposal → awaiting approval → implementation → verification
→ archival → PR ready for human review → confirmed merge**. Review and optional e2e
checks live within verification. Retries, questions, status replies and silence check-ins
do not repeat the diagram. The assets are pre-rendered SVG/PNG pairs under
`src/assets/milestones/`; outgoing mail includes an inline PNG with a plain-text stage
label, and Slack uploads the PNG to the task thread. Completing or aborting a task
without a confirmed GitHub merge never announces the merge milestone.

Proposal-review messages attach one **offline, self-contained HTML file** containing
the actual change's `proposal.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md` and all nested
`specs/**/spec.md` files. Its left index links to files and headings and can be
filtered; it uses no hosted assets. Each revision regenerates this package and
summarizes changed sections against the last version sent. Generated files and
snapshots are stored under git-ignored `data/review_packages/`, rather than in the
target repo. If required artifacts are missing or the full attachment exceeds the
configured mail limit, codebot asks for help instead of requesting approval of an
incomplete package. Approval and merge still require the same explicit replies.

Messages awaiting input start with the decision or question. Before asking for PR
review, codebot presents recorded verification outcomes (including skipped checks),
what changed, the PR and task links, and an index of evidence that was actually
available. After feedback is pushed, it relates the request to the changes and
new evidence. Upload failures are called out rather than passing for delivered files.

**At PR creation**, before waiting for an optional automated Code Review run, codebot
also sends a separate, informational architecture report. It compares the archived
OpenSpec plan with the committed PR diff, calls out high-impact implemented decisions
and unverified assumptions (for example, a separate managed database or elevated
container permissions), and links each item to a changed PR file. If review or later
feedback materially changes one of these decisions, only the delta is sent. An
unavailable analysis does not claim that no decisions exist. This report never asks
for another approval or delays automated review, the PR-ready handoff or merge.

Every tick starts by checking the mailbox for commands (ABORT / STATUS / DONE / HOLD /
CONTINUE, see below). Any state that keeps failing detours through WAIT_STUCK (see
"Failure handling"), and HOLD parks a task from any state.
Any phase can detour through WAIT_REPLY: if the coding agent needs the user, it ends its
output with `NEED_USER_INPUT: <question>`; codebot sends the question in the task's
configured email or Slack thread (optionally with `ATTACH: <path>` screenshots/videos)
and resumes the same session with the reply. When an exploration reply completes the
phase without another question, its explanation is sent to that thread before proposing.

Evidence (screenshots, recordings, reports) is always routed to the task thread via that same
`ATTACH: <path>` convention (saved under the outbox dir), in every phase — never
committed to the target repo. Every resumed turn restates this rule. As a safety
net, designated handoffs after implementation and review or feedback repairs scan
the branch diff for evidence-looking files (video extensions, or paths naming
"evidence"/"recording") and have the coding agent remove and re-route them via
the configured channel if any are found.

## Phase discipline (planning never implements)

EXPLORING and PROPOSING are planning phases: their prompts forbid implementing,
committing, and pushing, and every WAIT_REPLY resume restates the active phase's
rules. As a backstop, when either phase completes codebot **mechanically reverts
overreach**: premature commits are undone (`git reset --soft` to the branch base),
tracked changes outside `openspec/` are discarded, and a note about what was cleaned
up is included in the proposal email. Openspec change artifacts are the phases'
legitimate output and are always kept.

Replies to a question (WAIT_REPLY) are classified first: an answer resumes the working
session with the phase rules restated; "mark it complete" / "abort" act on the
lifecycle directly instead of being forwarded to a session that cannot act on them.

## Failure handling (WAIT_STUCK)

No state retries forever in silence. Each state has a **consecutive-failure budget**
(`CODEBOT_MAX_STATE_FAILURES`, default 5), tracked in `state.json` and reset on any
successful tick. When a state exhausts its budget — or a phase asks more than
`CODEBOT_QUESTION_MAX_ROUNDS` (default 8) questions in a row — codebot emails you
(`stuck in <STATE>`, with the last error) and enters `WAIT_STUCK`. Reply on that
thread with:

- **retry** — try the failed step again (clears the counter),
- **abort** — reset to a clean slate (same as the ABORT command below),
- **complete** — mark the task done in the backlog and move on, or
- **instructions** — free-form guidance; codebot applies it in the working session, then
  resumes the failed step.

Every external `git`/`gh` call has a timeout (`CODEBOT_SUBPROCESS_TIMEOUT`, default 120s)
so a hung command surfaces as a failure (feeding the budget) instead of wedging the loop.

Every working prompt starts with an "execution environment" preamble of runtime facts.
Add project-specific ones (how to run the tests, what is NOT available in the
container) in `data/environment.md` or `CODEBOT_ENVIRONMENT_NOTES`. Untrusted text
(e2e output, review comments, email bodies) is fenced as data inside prompts so an
embedded instruction cannot hijack the flow.

## Silence check-ins (is it stuck?)

A task can go quiet for hours — an implementation session, a slow `Code Review`
run, or simply a question you haven't answered yet — and the thread gives no hint
whether codebot is working or wedged. So while a task is in flight, codebot emails a
short **check-in** on the task thread whenever the thread has been quiet (no email
sent *or* received on it) for the next interval of a decaying back-off:
`CODEBOT_PING_SCHEDULE`, default `30m,1h,2h,3h,5h,8h` — the first check-in 30 min
after the last real email, the next 1 h after that check-in, then 2 h, 3 h, 5 h, and
every 8 h from there (the last interval repeats). Any real email in either direction
restarts the schedule; check-ins themselves don't count. Set it to `off` to disable.

Every check-in says whose move it is, and is self-contained:

- **Ball on codebot's side** (a working phase, or WAIT_REVIEW): what it is doing —
  the step, when it started, and for WAIT_REVIEW the PR, how long it has waited, what
  GitHub currently reports for the run and when it will give up — plus whether recent
  attempts at the step have been failing.
- **Ball on your side** (WAIT_APPROVAL / WAIT_MERGE / WAIT_REPLY / WAIT_STUCK /
  WAIT_CLEAN): exactly what it needs from you, spelled out in full (the pending
  question, the PR link and the accepted replies, the stuck step and its error), with
  its last email quoted for reference — never "see above".

Check-ins go out from the tick loop, so one can lag while a single long agent call is
running (bounded by `CODEBOT_AGENT_TIMEOUT`); it is sent as soon as that call returns.
STATUS reports the last real email on the thread and how many check-ins followed it.

During an in-flight phase, `status?` (or `STATUS`) gets an independent, **brief**
answer in the task thread without waiting for the coding agent to finish. In Gmail
the supervisor checks for status mail during long turns; in Slack it reads the
durable Socket Mode inbox and, if an event was missed, reconciles the active thread
through Slack's API at most once a minute. It also accepts a top-level status request.
Other commands remain queued for the main state machine. The reply names the task,
phase, elapsed time and the last observed OpenCode tool activity, when available.
Recent activity is a sign of progress; after five minutes without observable activity, it explicitly
says progress cannot be confirmed. Claude or non-agent phases may not expose step
telemetry, so the reply does not claim they are healthy or stuck without evidence.
No second coding-agent session is started and no task state is modified by the
supervisor. Between turns, the regular `STATUS` command still returns the full
state snapshot.

If a bot was already executing an agent turn when updated code was copied to its
bind-mounted `/app`, restarting that container would interrupt the turn. For a
Slack task, `python3 /app/scripts/status_watch.py` may instead run as a separate
container process until the task changes phase. It uses the same bounded Slack
history reconciliation, answers only `STATUS`, and never starts another agent or
writes the bot's task state. The built-in supervisor takes over at the next normal
container restart.

## Mailbox commands: ABORT / STATUS / DONE / HOLD / CONTINUE

Email codebot with a body of exactly `ABORT`, `STATUS`, `DONE`, `HOLD` (or `PAUSE`),
or `CONTINUE` (or `RESUME`, which may be followed by a note) — case-insensitive,
trailing punctuation tolerated — optionally with an instance name (`ABORT codebot-x7k2`)
when several instances share the mailbox — see "Multiple instances" below for how bare
commands are scoped.
All are checked at the start of every tick and mailbox-wide (any thread, or a brand-new
email), so they work even when the agent is stuck waiting on a thread — or in
WAIT_REVIEW, which never polls the inbox. **Only mail from `CODEBOT_USER_EMAIL` is
honored** (it may be a comma-separated list) — a stranger emailing "ABORT" is ignored.
Thread replies are held to the same rule: mail from any other sender in a task thread
is logged and ignored.

- **ABORT** discards the working-tree changes, returns to a clean, up-to-date base branch
  (`git reset --hard` + `checkout -f $CODEBOT_BASE_BRANCH` + `clean -fd` + fast-forward
  to `origin/$CODEBOT_BASE_BRANCH`), clears all task state, and goes back to IDLE —
  then emails a confirmation. It only touches the **local** checkout: remote branches
  and PRs are left as-is (clean those up on GitHub yourself if needed). The check runs
  between phases, so an abort sent mid-phase takes effect once the current agent call
  returns.
- **STATUS** replies with a snapshot — instance, current state, task/slug/branch, PR
  URL, pending question, stuck state and failure counters, last transition time, round
  counters, heartbeat age, tasks on hold, the time of the last real email on the task
  thread and the check-ins sent since, and the full text of the last email codebot
  sent — without changing anything.
- **HOLD** (or **PAUSE**) parks the current task: any half-finished git operation is
  aborted, all pending work is committed on the task branch (evidence files excluded),
  the task's state is saved in `data/holds.json`, its bullet in the doc gets an
  `[on hold: <instance>]` marker (no instance picks it), and codebot returns to IDLE
  to take the next item. Reply **CONTINUE** (or **RESUME**, optionally followed by
  instructions) on the held task's thread to bring it back: it becomes the very next
  task codebot picks (after the one in progress, or immediately when idle), restored
  on its branch and session; the instructions are handed to the task as the reply to
  whatever it was waiting on, and without them codebot re-sends its last message so
  you know what it is still waiting for. Held tasks are listed in `data/holds.json`
  and by STATUS. A bare "continue" on the **active** task's thread is ordinary
  conversation, not this command.
- **DONE** marks the current task complete: strikes the item through in the backlog
  doc, resets the local checkout to a clean base branch, and returns to IDLE to pick
  the next item. Use it when the work turned out to already be done (e.g. an earlier
  PR covered it) and the bot is waiting on a thread you'd rather not continue. A bare
  reply on the **active task thread** is never treated as this command (so answering
  "Done" to a question doesn't complete the task) — send it on any other thread or a
  fresh email, or target the instance explicitly (`DONE codebot-x7k2`).

## Automated code review (WAIT_REVIEW ⇄ ADDRESS_REVIEW)

After opening the PR, codebot waits for the target repo's **`Code Review`** GitHub
Action (OpenCodeReview) to finish (`CODEBOT_REVIEW_WAIT_TIMEOUT`, default 45 min per
run). The work queue is the PR's **unresolved review threads** (queried through
GraphQL, so a thread the agent skipped or one posted after a run stays in the queue
instead of silently accumulating until merge time). For each thread opened by the
reviewer bot the working session either fixes the issue (commit; codebot pushes via
PUSHING, which re-triggers the action) or declares it not worth fixing — and either way
emits `RESOLVE: <thread_id> <reason>`; codebot posts the reason as a reply on the
thread and marks it resolved. Only thread ids codebot itself fetched are honored. The
loop is capped by `CODEBOT_REVIEW_MAX_ROUNDS` (default 3); leftovers are mentioned in
the "PR ready" email. A failed thread query is never read as "no threads".

While waiting for your merge decision (WAIT_MERGE) codebot keeps polling the PR for
unresolved threads from anyone (a human reviewer included) and addresses them
(ADDRESS_PR_THREADS, capped by `CODEBOT_PR_THREAD_MAX_ROUNDS`). Human threads are
handled differently from the bot reviewer's: the agent sees the **whole thread** (every
comment, its own earlier replies labelled, the latest comment marked as the one to
answer) and is told the reviewer's word is final — a change request is implemented, not
debated, and a repeated request after an earlier explanation is implemented without
further argument. A thread that only asked a question gets an `answered: …` reply and is
**left open** for the reviewer to close; codebot does not touch it again until they post
something new. On `merge` it re-checks: unresolved threads (or a failed query) **block
the merge** with an email listing them; reply `merge anyway` to force. Merging is
irreversible, so the classifier must return an explicit `force: true` for that.

## Base-branch conflicts (RESOLVE_CONFLICTS)

While a PR is open (WAIT_REVIEW / WAIT_MERGE), every reply-less tick checks the PR's
state. A PR **merged on GitHub by someone else** finishes the task exactly as codebot's
own merge would (item marked done, "task complete" email); one **closed without
merging** stops with a stuck email asking whether to `complete`, `abort`, or reopen it
and `retry`. A `CONFLICTING` PR (the base branch moved — another PR merged) detours
through RESOLVE_CONFLICTS: the working session merges `origin/$CODEBOT_BASE_BRANCH`
into the branch (**merge, never rebase** — the branch is pushed), re-runs the tests and
commits; codebot pushes and the automated review re-runs before the PR can merge. A
conflict with genuinely different reasonable resolutions is emailed as a question
instead of guessed at. Attempts are capped by `CODEBOT_CONFLICT_MAX_ROUNDS` (default 3),
then the task escalates to WAIT_STUCK. Replies the user sent against the pre-conflict
PR content are set aside and the "PR ready" email says so.

## One-time setup

**Recommended**: run the guided terminal setup on a macOS or Linux host.
`scripts/setup.sh` works from bash or zsh, bootstraps a pinned Textual UI into
`.venv/`, and falls back to a menu-driven text mode if that UI is unavailable.
The first screen lists Repository, Backlog, Conversation, Agent, Evidence and
Advanced. Open sections in any order; `Test` checks only the current section
and its saved prerequisites, while `Save and Close` repeats that test and
immediately saves that section to `.env` on success. Failures leave the section
open with its draft intact and explain what to fix. A checkmark appears beside
saved sections; changing a dependency clears affected checkmarks. The menu's
`Test full setup` checks the whole saved configuration; `Exit` needs no final
save. Text mode offers the same menu with `t`/`s`/`e`/`d` in each section.
The main menu also has **Sync to VM** (`v` in text mode): enter `user@host`,
choose code-only (default) or confirm an initial copy, and optionally recreate
the remote bot container and wait for its health check. This runs against the
saved configuration; the SSH host is not stored in `.env`.
The preview masks secrets; Advanced searches every runtime setting, including
inactive integrations and timeouts. On repeat runs setup preserves unknown
keys, comments, untouched credentials and inactive settings in `.env`, backs
up the original, and writes successful sections atomically:

```bash
scripts/setup.sh
scripts/setup.sh --text    # also works: bash scripts/setup.sh / zsh scripts/setup.sh

After configuring `.env`, stop any running bot on both machines and run:

```bash
bash scripts/sync-to-vm.sh azureuser@74.235.122.91
```

This uses `rsync` over SSH to copy this checkout to `~/codebot/app/`
and the local checkout named by `CODEBOT_REPO_PATH` to `~/codebot/target/`.
It includes `.git`, durable files in `data/`, `.env`, source and lockfiles, but excludes
`node_modules/`, `.venv/`, `venv/` and `ms-playwright/`: binaries installed
on an M1 Mac cannot run on an amd64 Linux VM. The target repo must install its
dependencies and Chromium for Linux/amd64 in the environment where its tests
run (the Coderbot image already installs Chromium's Linux system libraries;
the target's `e2e/run.sh` installs its pinned browser at runtime). If you
previously copied Mac-built dependencies to the VM, remove those stale copies
before installing Linux versions; rsync deliberately does not delete VM files.
The transient `data/heartbeat` is not copied; the container resets its
heartbeat at each start so an old timestamp cannot trigger a restart loop.
The script also copies your local `~/.npmrc` to the VM user's home with mode
`0600` so `docker-compose.override.yml` can mount it. At container startup,
the root entrypoint copies it from a read-only seed into the bot user's home
with mode `0600`. Short-lived registry tokens will need refreshing on the VM;
restart the container afterward so it picks up the replacement.
The copy does not delete files already on the VM, but does replace files
with the same names. Do not run both copies as separate bots against the same
backlog: the copied `data/` includes this installation's ownership identity.
On the VM, `~/codebot/app/.env.local` preserves the original local `.env`,
and `.env` gets
VM-specific paths (`CODEBOT_REPO_PATH` points to the target on that VM;
absolute paths into the app become container paths under `/app`). The local
`.env` is untouched. The script refuses to overwrite an existing `.env.local`;
move that backup aside before running a new one-time copy. Other configured
absolute paths outside these two checkouts must be configured separately;
the script stops before copying if it cannot translate them. Check VM-specific
mounts in the copied
`docker-compose.override.yml` and the host's `~/.claude.json`/`~/.claude` as
needed before starting Compose on the VM.
OpenCode's `data/opencode/cache/` is excluded from the initial copy: the VM
rebuilds its own platform-specific tools (including `rg`), while its credentials,
sessions and state in `data/opencode/data/` remain part of the migration.
For later code updates, use `bash scripts/sync-to-vm.sh azureuser@74.235.122.91 --code-only`.
This leaves the VM's `data/`, `.env`, `.env.local`, `~/.npmrc` and target checkout
untouched; restart the VM's bot container to load the new Python code.
The script uses passwordless `sudo` on the VM to give uid/gid `501` ownership
of `~/codebot/app/data` and `~/codebot/target`: the container's non-root bot
must be able to write its instance fingerprint, state and Git working tree.
If sudo is unavailable during the copy, run this on the VM before starting
the container:

```bash
sudo chown -R 501:501 ~/codebot/app/data ~/codebot/target
```

### Start with no previous task

If the copied `data/state.json` refers to an earlier backlog or email thread,
stop the bot and reset **only** its task/conversation state on the VM:

```bash
cd ~/codebot/app
docker compose stop codebot
sudo python3 -m scripts.reset_bot_state
docker compose up -d codebot
```

The script moves the old active task, holds, Slack inbox and heartbeat into a
private timestamped directory under `data/`. It retains the installation's
identity, OpenCode/Google credentials and email deduplication markers, and does
not modify the target repo or the original backlog item. You can inspect the
backup path printed by the command if the old task needs manual reconciliation.

Slack: create the bot `xoxb-` token under [OAuth & Permissions](https://api.slack.com/apps)
with `channels:read`, `channels:history`, `chat:write` and `files:write`; install
or reinstall the app after changing scopes. Enable Socket Mode and create the
`xapp-` app-level token with `connections:write` under Basic Information. Invite
**that app's bot** to an active public channel using its Add people/apps menu.
Conversation lists only public channels joined by that bot; `Test` checks both
tokens, membership **and** `channels:history` read access. If it reports a
missing scope, add the named bot scope and reinstall the app; if it reports
non-membership, invite the bot and reload channels. Neither error saves `.env`.
Backlog lists accessible Jira projects and workflow statuses or GitHub Projects
boards after their credentials are available. Setup offers Google consent and
OpenCode provider login actions in relevant sections, and requests only the
Google APIs needed by the selected backlog, channel and Drive upload setting.
All editable keys/defaults are in [`.env.example`](.env.example); a coverage
test catches newly added runtime options missing from setup.

<details>
<summary>Manual setup (what <code>scripts/setup.sh</code> automates)</summary>

1. **Google OAuth client (when using email, GDoc or Drive upload)**: in Google
   Cloud Console create a project, enable the needed Gmail, Docs and/or Drive
   APIs, create an OAuth client of type
   *Desktop app*, and download its JSON to `data/credentials.json`. The consent
   asks for full Drive access when the activity trail posts comments on a Doc or
   evidence videos are uploaded to Drive. Jira+Slack with evidence upload off
   needs no Google credentials.
2. **Consent flow** (on the host, from the coderbot repo root):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python3 scripts/setup_oauth.py     # opens a browser; writes data/token.json
   ```
3. **Configuration**: create `.env` at the repo root (see `.env.example`):

   can't read — hence the explicit token.)

</details>

4. **Coding-agent authentication**: Claude Code uses the host's `~/.claude` and
   `~/.claude.json`. OpenCode is installed in the Codebot Docker image; `scripts/setup.sh`
   runs its authentication flow there and stores credentials privately under
   `data/opencode/`. This includes browser and device-code provider flows. Git pushes
   use HTTPS with `GH_TOKEN` (no SSH needed).

## Run

From the coderbot repo root:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f
```

State lives in `data/state.json`; the container restarts safely from any state.
To abort the current task, email `ABORT` (see "Mailbox commands") — or stop the
container, delete `data/state.json`, remove the task's `[implementing: …]` marker in
the doc, clean the git branch, restart.

Everything codebot must remember across restarts lives in `data/` — Google
OAuth when needed, `state.json`, `holds.json`, `instance_id`,
`instance_fingerprint`, the processed-mail list and `slack_inbox.sqlite` when
using Slack — and both compose files bind-mount that directory from the host (never a
named volume), so it survives container recreation, `docker compose down -v`, and
image rebuilds. On a disposable server, back up `data/` (or restore it from your
provisioning) before replacing the host.

Only one codebot may run against a `data/` dir: startup takes a lock on
`data/state.lock` and a second process exits immediately. The container reports
Docker health from a heartbeat the tick loop maintains (`docker inspect --format
'{{.State.Health.Status}}' coderbot-codebot-1`); a loop wedged beyond any plausible
operation (past `CODEBOT_HEARTBEAT_HARD`, ~2.5h) is force-restarted via the
`restart: unless-stopped` policy.

### On a Linux server (EC2)

`docker-compose.ec2.yml` is the same stack with fixed host paths: this repo at
`/opt/coderbot`, the `.env` at `/opt/codebot/codebot.env`, the bot's `~/.claude` at
`/opt/codebot/claude` (with `.credentials.json`), a read-only `~/.claude.json` seed at
`/opt/codebot/claude.json`, and the Google OAuth files in `/opt/coderbot/data/`. The
target repo path comes from `CODEBOT_REPO_PATH` in the env file. Provision those files
(e.g. from a secrets manager in the instance's user-data), `chown -R 501` both trees,
then:

```bash
cd /opt/coderbot && docker compose -f docker-compose.ec2.yml up -d --build
```

For a fleet of agents on cheap interruptible instances, each with a persistent disk so
a reclaimed agent resumes its task, there are two self-contained deployments:
[`deploy/aws/`](deploy/aws/README.md) (CloudFormation, Spot instances and an EBS volume
per agent) and [`deploy/azure/`](deploy/azure/README.md) (Bicep, Spot VMs and a managed
disk per agent). Each is driven entirely by its cloud's CLI.

## Multiple instances

Any number of codebots can share a backlog. New installations generate a stable
readable name in `data/instance_id` (e.g. `codebot-warty-warthog`) and an opaque
ownership fingerprint in `data/instance_fingerprint`. Existing `codebot-x7k2`
names are retained. The readable name tags email subjects and git branches;
`CODEBOT_INSTANCE` may override it. **Back up both files** with the rest of `data/`.

Instances coordinate only through the backlog. In the Doc, picking a task atomically
appends `[implementing: <instance>@<fingerprint>]` to its bullet (the write carries the doc revision
it was read at, so two instances can't both win). On a GitHub board, picking adds the
`codebot:<instance>@<fingerprint>` label to the issue and re-reads it; if another instance's label
landed too, both back off and repick next tick. Claimed tasks are invisible to the
others' PICK until the marker/label is removed on completion or abort. Legacy
name-only markers are adopted only when locally saved task state identifies them;
otherwise they need manual reconciliation. If an
installation is retired mid-task, send it `ABORT <name>` first (which unclaims) or
remove the marker/label by hand.

Email-mode instances can share a Gmail account; each one only reads replies on its own
threads (subjects carry its prefix). Address mailbox commands to one instance —
`ABORT codebot-x7k2`, `STATUS codebot-x7k2`, `DONE codebot-x7k2`, `HOLD codebot-x7k2`
— or reply with the bare command on one of its threads. A bare `ABORT` or `STATUS`
sent anywhere else is honored by **every** instance (fleet-wide stop / fleet status —
their last-resort role); a bare `DONE`, `HOLD` or `CONTINUE` outside an instance's
threads is ignored, since they act on one instance's task. Only the instance that put
a task on hold can resume it; delete its `[on hold: …]` marker by hand to free the task
for anyone. In Slack mode each instance uses separate app credentials; commands
only work as replies in that app's own task threads, never as fleet-wide top-level
messages.

## Toolchain versions

The image pins exact versions for reproducible rebuilds: the base image
(`python:3.12.13-slim`), the claude-code, opencode and openspec CLIs (`@<version>` in
the `Dockerfile`), the Superpowers plugin (`config.SUPERPOWERS_VERSION`), Node (major
`22` via nodesource), and the Python deps (`==` in `requirements.txt`). To bump: read
the version currently working in the running container (`docker compose exec codebot
claude --version`, `… openspec --version`), edit the pin, and rebuild
(`docker compose up -d --build`). Don't switch these to floating/`latest` — a silent
CLI behavior change between rebuilds is exactly what the pins prevent.

## Smoke tests

Inside the container (`docker compose exec codebot bash`):

```bash
claude -p 'say ok' --model "$CLAUDE_MODEL" --dangerously-skip-permissions  # CODEBOT_AGENT=claude
opencode run --auto --model "$OPENCODE_MODEL" 'say ok' # when CODEBOT_AGENT=opencode
gh auth status                                       # GH token works
git -C "$CODEBOT_REPO_PATH" fetch                    # HTTPS auth via GH_TOKEN works
cd src && python3 -c 'import task_source; task_source.validate(); print(task_source.list_pending_items())'
cd src && python3 -c 'import gmail_client; print(gmail_client.send("[codebot] test", "hello"))'  # email mode
cd src && python3 -c 'import slack_client; slack_client.validate(); print("Slack app and public channel accessible")' # Slack mode
```

Unit tests, on the host from the repo root:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -t .
```

### Manual integration smoke (using a disposable task)

1. Run `scripts/setup.sh` on macOS or Linux and review/save a configuration
   with Jira+Slack. Repeat with `scripts/setup.sh --text`, change one Advanced
   value, and verify the old `.env` backup still has every untouched line,
   secret and comment. Verify GDoc+Slack and Jira+email selections separately.
2. In the selected Jira project create a disposable issue in the configured pick
   **status** with `CODEBOT_JIRA_PICK_LABEL`, and another issue in the same status
   without that label. Start Coderbot; the unlabeled issue must stay untouched.
   Confirm one fingerprinted claim label on the labeled issue and one
   root Slack message bearing the issue link and instance name. With a second
   bot app in the same public channel, check that only the owning app responds
   to replies in that thread. Reply `STATUS`, then `HOLD`; the issue should be
   held and the bot can claim another issue. Reply `CONTINUE` on the original
   thread to recover it. Restart the container while a reply is pending and
   confirm that the reply is handled once.
3. Approve the proposal in the same thread. When the PR opens, verify
   `Closes <JIRA-KEY>` plus a Jira URL in its body, a PR link in a Jira comment,
   and Jira's review status (not done). Review the PR and reply `merge`; Jira
   should transition to done and lose only this bot's ownership label. Repeat
   with `DONE` and `ABORT` on disposable issues to verify each transition.
4. In Slack mode with a dirty checkout before any issue is claimed, confirm one
   operational announcement, ignored replies to it, and automatic retry once
   the checkout is cleaned. If evidence is available, inspect the Drive video
   link and an uploaded report/image in the task thread. Test long proposal
   messages and a post-conflict stale merge reply on a disposable PR.

## Troubleshooting

**`managed runtime unavailable: missing ...`**: coderbot fails closed at startup if
the image's managed Superpowers, coderbot/OpenSpec bridge or generated OpenSpec skill
files are absent. Rebuild the image from this repository and check that no volume
mount replaces `/opt/coderbot/plugins`, `/opt/coderbot/agent-plugin` or
`/opt/coderbot/openspec-skills`; do not install Superpowers or run `openspec init` in
the target repo or host profile as a workaround.

**`Claude Code X does not support this model; version Y or newer is required`** (or
`There's an issue with the selected model`): the `@anthropic-ai/claude-code@<version>`
pin in the `Dockerfile` predates `CLAUDE_MODEL`. Bump the pin to a version that knows
the model (see "Toolchain versions") and rebuild; also double-check the model id
spelling (`claude-fable-5-1`, dashes only).

**OpenCode provider authentication fails or returns `401 Unauthorized`**: rerun
`scripts/setup.sh` and complete authentication for `OPENCODE_PROVIDER`, then retry the
OpenCode smoke command above. A provider 401 is a failed smoke test; never treat the
CLI starting or returning structured output as a pass when the provider rejected the
request.

**`claude exited 1: apiKeyHelper failed: did not return a value`**: the target repo
has its own `.claude/settings.json` (project-level, applies to any `claude` invocation
with cwd in that repo) that defines an `apiKeyHelper` script codebot doesn't satisfy.
Claude Code's authentication precedence always tries `apiKeyHelper` *before*
`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, with **no fallback** if the helper fails or returns
nothing — so this silently breaks codebot's OAuth auth for that repo regardless of a
valid `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`. Check what env var the helper reads (e.g.
`cat "$CODEBOT_REPO_PATH/.claude/settings.json"`) and set it to a real key from
[console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/) via `CLAUDE_API_KEY` in
`.env` (see `.env.example`) — codebot's work in that repo will then bill via that
API key instead of your OAuth/subscription plan. Note some apps regenerate
`.claude/settings.json` at their own startup (check whether it's gitignored); if so,
the setting will keep reappearing and `CLAUDE_API_KEY` is the durable fix rather than
hand-editing the file.

## Logs

All activity is logged to stdout (visible via `docker compose logs -f`). At the
default `DEBUG` level you see every state transition, each coding-agent invocation
(model, effort, prompt size, returned session/output size, whether it hit the
`NEED_USER_INPUT` sentinel), every email sent (subject, thread, attachment count
and byte totals, any size-skipped files), reply and command received, git/gh
commands, the e2e suite result, review-thread activity, and the evidence-video
harvest (which `.webm` files were found and their sizes — with explicit warnings if
none were produced or a feature shipped without e2e specs). Failures are logged with
their per-state count (`cycle failed in E2E (2/5)`). Set `CODEBOT_LOG_LEVEL=INFO` for
a quieter feed; STATUS by email gives the same picture without the logs.

## Evidence

If the target repo has an e2e harness, the implementation phase adds coverage for
it and, once the suite passes, codebot re-runs the feature's own tests to capture
evidence for the PR handoff in the selected conversation channel:

- **Playwright**: the implementation must include one demo test tagged `@evidence`
  that walks through the feature visibly. Codebot first re-runs only that test
  (`./run.sh <spec> --grep @evidence`), falling back to the feature's full specs when
  no clip appears, with `PICA_E2E_VIDEO=on` and `PW_VIDEO=on` exported (either forces
  `video: "on"` in `e2e/playwright.config.ts`). The resulting `.webm` clips from
  `e2e/test-results/` are stitched into a single H.264 `data/evidence.mp4` with ffmpeg
  (each clip scaled/padded to 1280x720 so mixed viewport sizes concatenate cleanly).
  If ffmpeg is unavailable or stitching fails, it falls back to attaching the raw
  `.webm` clips.
- **Newman**: re-runs the feature's collection(s) and attaches the newest
  generated report file from `e2e/test-results/`.

The stitched mp4 is not attached when Drive upload is enabled: it is uploaded to Google Drive
(`CODEBOT_EVIDENCE_UPLOAD`, default on) and linked from the PR email — and, because
the activity trail mirrors email bodies, from the issue comment or doc thread too,
so reviewers reading the ticket can watch it. Videos land in a `Codebot evidence`
folder found or created at the root of the bot account's My Drive, or in the folder
given by `CODEBOT_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` (shared drives work). Each file is named
`<branch>-<timestamp>.mp4` and shared as "anyone with the link" (reader); if a
Workspace policy forbids link sharing the upload still succeeds and the link is
sent, but only the bot account can open it. Any upload failure — including a
`data/token.json` issued before the full `drive` scope was requested (re-run
`python3 scripts/setup_oauth.py`) — is logged and the mp4 is attached instead,
subject to `CODEBOT_MAX_ATTACH_BYTES` as before. Newman reports and agent-supplied
screenshots are always attached, never uploaded.

If no e2e harness is present for the task, no evidence is produced and the PR
email is sent without an attachment.

A `run.sh` that exceeds `CODEBOT_E2E_TIMEOUT` is killed, which skips its own cleanup
trap; codebot then tears down the harness's compose stack itself
(`docker compose -f $CODEBOT_E2E_COMPOSE_FILE down -v`, default
`docker-compose.e2e.yaml`, skipped when the file doesn't exist) so leaked containers
don't collide with the next run.
